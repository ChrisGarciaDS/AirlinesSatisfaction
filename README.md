# Predicting Airlines Customer Satisfaction

Purpose:

Knowing how satisfied a customer is with the level of service offered by a company can either propel it forward or result in its downfall. Recognizing which services are particularly important to a consumer provide both existing and budding airlines with focal points that could enable their business to stand out among their competition. Working with the data available on passenger satisfaction on services offered by multiple US airlines will discern which amenities need further attention, or even incorporation into an airline’s business model, and which amenities are insignificant.
Background:

Over the last century the travel industry has pivoted from sea voyages to air travel, primarily due to the benefits provided to passengers from a timeliness perspective. Trips that would take days, weeks, or even months to complete now occur in a matter of hours. Although air travel was initially greeted with skepticism at the start of the 20th century, the United States now has nearly 20,000 airports responsible for roughly 45,000 flights per day, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (Ref: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers). The concerns of whether a flight can travel to a particular destination are now merely preliminary barriers to entry for the industry.

Current Situation:
With 61 active US airlines, with 18 producing over 1 billion dollars in revenue a year (REF: https://www.statista.com/statistics/278372/revenue-of-commercial-airlines-worldwide/), it can be hard for an airline to standout and attract consumers. With numerous airlines flying to the same destinations at similar times, customer retention no longer falls on the quantity of service but its quality. Airline cancellations and delays are generally a red flag when it comes to passenger satisfaction, earning Southwest its infamy, but a variety of other airline characteristics and available amenities can play a vital role in the business’s success. Factors such as wi-fi service, food/drink options, cleanliness of the aircraft, and seat comfort are all some of the many elements that can make or break a person’s flight. Determining exactly how large of a role they play in a customer’s overall satisfaction is what we aim to find out.
